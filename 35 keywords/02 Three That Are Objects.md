#boolean values

## True
Indicator of logical truth and the opposite of False ; behaves like the integer 1, except that it will always be displayed as True.

## False
Indicator of logical untruth and the opposite of True ; behaves like the integer 0, except that it will always be displayed as False.


#the null value

## None
A special name for nothing whatsoever; technically Python’s null object; it’s considered equivalent to False for truth-value testing, but essentially represents no value at all. Is very commonly used in Python, and will always appear as None.
